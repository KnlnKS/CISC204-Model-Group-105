# How to create custom Pokemon Teams

Hi, you may want to test out creating your own Pokemon Teams.  
Great! However, you may not know how to get started ðŸ˜ž. Don't worry!   
That's what this md file is for! I'll detail step-by-step how to make your own teams!

1. Go to https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/formats/ou/,  
https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/formats/uu/,  
https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/formats/ru/ or  
https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/formats/pu/.

2. Choose a Pokemon you want to add, how about Charizard-X from ou?

3. Choose one of the sets and click Export. You'll get text like the following:
```
Charizard @ Charizardite X
Ability: Blaze
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
Jolly Nature
- Dragon Dance
- Flare Blitz
- Earthquake
- Roost
```
4. Add a startegy, if you don't know what to choose take a glance at the writeup.  
This one mentions wall breaker, so add that:
```
Charizard @ Charizardite X
Ability: Blaze
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
Strategy: Wall Breaker
Jolly Nature
- Dragon Dance
- Flare Blitz
- Earthquake
- Roost
```
5. Add an end line and you're done! Just paste that into the custome_team.txt file. 
Make sure not to have more than 6 Pokemon in there, or else the program crashes!
```
Charizard @ Charizardite X
Ability: Blaze
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
Strategy: Wall Breaker
Jolly Nature
- Dragon Dance
- Flare Blitz
- Earthquake
- Roost
#End Pokemon
```

6. Additionally, you can copy Pokemon from the pokemon.txt file in the parent directory.
